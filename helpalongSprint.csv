We don’t mind what the animations look like as long as there is at least two more than the one already available to choose from. this could be something like the words flying away, dissolving or anything that makes the textbox go away with an animation.

The current resource page works for now, but they are looking to expand much further. They love all the color of the website, so they have asked that we add more of that to the page as well as more artwork. Additionally, they want more types of resources, things such as self-improvement articles, meditation site links, various mental health organizations, and help lines. Here is specifically what they have lined out:

* New layout with sections for resources 
* More color across the page 
* Added articles and other resources 
* Titles for each resource on the links 
* Arrows for links rather than giant blocks of text for links
* Horizontally scrollable sections of resources 

This will give our site much more value and offer more to our users. The stakeholders are really looking forward to all the benefits the users will get from this, and the easy access to add more resources potentially over time.

They would like an additional piece to this where a reminder of their choice can be added, such as 15 minutes or 30 minutes. With this they will be able to be reminder via their email. This makes this feature much more useful because now instead of having to go check what events you have coming up you can just be reminded in a timely manner. The feature would preferably be a list of times you can choose from on when to be reminder and you will be able to add it from the site when adding a new event.

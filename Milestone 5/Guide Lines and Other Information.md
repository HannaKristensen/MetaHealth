# Guidelines #


Please follow the guidelines listed below when contributing code to this project.  Please keep in mind that this project was started as a University class and some decisions have been made with students and teaching in mind.


## Overall ##


* Write code in C# and javascript and CSS. If something else is needed come to the group to talk about it so we can all get it
* Write comments for functions so that we can better understand each other's code
* Test code locally before making a pull request
*Pull to your branch before making a pull request
* Keep code as consistent as possible so that it is easy to read
* Make other team members aware of files one is currently working in on the google doc open-files(i.e “Hey everyone im working in program.cs”)
*Do not under any circumstances update anything until this project is done
*Talk about what we are doing specifically before each sprint so everyone is on the same page




## C# ##
* Variable naming conventions:
    * Bool: start with “is” or “has” and keep them positive when possible
* Functions: CamelCase starting with uppercase letter
* Member variables: camelCase starting with lowercase letter
*Use code maid to keep code nice and clean
*Use MVC system
*Don’t put mass amounts of code into an controller if you can use a model instead


## Git ##

* Use branches
* Commit often (don't feel like you have to have made major, complete, changes or new features before committing)
* Write good commit messages
* Don't commit code that doesn't compile
*Saturday before the end of a Sprint is the last time to make a pull request


## Others ##
* Read the Milestones
* Use meeting times in an effective manner
* If you are running late or sick and can’t make it to a meeting let the group know

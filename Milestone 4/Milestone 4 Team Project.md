### Other Elicitation Activities
Refined Vision Statement:
**For**  those of us **who**  can be overwhelmed by the day-to-day, **the**  HelpAlong web app is an all encompassing coping tool **that**  provides a single point of access to various coping strategies. The website will offer a variety of services that help users find a therapist in their area, figure out which methods of self-care work best for them, keeps their daily lives organized and on track, and provides a coping space filled with positive activities. **Unlike**  other mental health management applications, **our product**  will provide a cohesive experience for the user to explore what self care and mental well-being means to them. 


﻿### Summary of Our Approach to Software Development:
The process we are following is the Disciplined Agile Delivery(DAD) approach. This approach allows us to work efficiently and smoothly, delivering product to the client in a proficient manner. We are choosing to keep this as simple as possible, while developing clean cut and efficient code. 




### Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders:
The initial vision discussion gave us quite a bit of information. Our client likes our ideas and wants us to do further research with psychology professionals. This concept is accomplishable within our skillset, and we will stick to DAD style programming approaches to remain organized and efficient. 




### Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation:
The major requirements given to us by the client are listed as follows:
1. Our project will have information and resources for people who sign up. This will entail having a quiz to figure out what features you may like. We will also have a page with resources like therapist and emergency services.
2. There will be a calendar and list to hold information about what you need to do and what you should be doing. List will hold events from your calendar and can hold levels of importance to tasks. There will be a calendar reminder about things that need to be done.
3. Coping space will be added where users can let go and relax. Things like meditation gifs and a writing space to put down your feelings will be needed. Other spaces might be added to help the user express their feelings and come back to a peaceful state of mind.

        Yes

        Yes

No

What mental health problems are you helping?
        We aren’t helping any one specific but are making features to help people in general no matter what there problems are.


Is this a diagnostic tool?
        We are not licensed therapists so we always recommend consulting a doctor, especially in the event of a medical emergency. HelpAlong is not meant to be used to diagnose users and leave that up to the professionals
       


### List of Needs and Features
1. I would like the list to have my events from my calendar so I can see what I need to do. As well as add things to my calendar. I should get reminded about these things and be able to check them off.
2. The list should have a level todo lists where users will be able to select what kind of level of activity they want to do. Being able to check this off and getting a nice notification to let the user know they did a good job when they are done.
3.  A space to write about my feelings and emotions in a non-documented manar. Where afterwards I can click submit and it will all go away. I can choose how I want to make the text go away.
4. A breathing / meditation space where I can see a gif to help me focus my breathing and listening to music. I can choose between some music and having no music as well as the gif and space color. 
5. I want to be able to see resources and ememercy information so that I can get help when needed or search for help. A page with this information will make it easy for users to find what they need
6. When I registered I want to be able to take a quiz where it will tell me what I may want to take a look at and use. The quiz will not be long and be easy to do. This will only appear when first registering
7. I want to be reminded about when to take my medication. I will get a good calendar reminder about it and can make it as done if I have taken it. I will get another reminder if I haven’t taken it by a certain time.

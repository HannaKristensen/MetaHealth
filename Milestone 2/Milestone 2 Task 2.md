Team Project Ideas


* Mental Health Management
1. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
While there are a number of helpful apps available to those who need a little extra help when it comes to mental health, these are mostly centered around meditation, breathing exercises, and mood trackers. While our idea intends to utilize these ideas, we would like to add many more features centered around mental health. Ads for Talkspace might litter the social media apps, but those can cost money. 
2. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
This idea is worth doing because many people hear this phrase “self-care” but very few are unsure as to what this means. Or worse, their idea of self-care is limited to things they don’t personally find relaxing (bubble baths, meditation, ASMR, etc). The goal of this application is to help users identify what self-care means to them and then helps them set up a schedule to keep them feeling clear headed and healthy.
3. What are a few major features?
A few major features of this app would be a medication management system, allowing users to customize daily reminders to take their pills and monthly reminders to refill. Another feature will be a mood tracker that helps users track their progress to see how their moods are improving (or not improving). There would also be premade to-do lists that cater to whatever level of mental faculties you have at your disposal that day. There would also be a list of emergency resources, both curated and user added. One of the main features will also be helping the user define what self care is for them
4. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
The algorithmic component of the application would be the analysis tool that users fill out when they first create their account. Upon logging in, the user will answer a series of questions that help guide them to what features t
hey want. We would be using Google API.  
5. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
Our group would rate this as a 7 on a scale from 1-10
